        <label>Ecommerce website</label>
        <p>I have developed an ecommerce website where users can register and sign up. Users have the ability to add products to their cart, remove items from the cart, and ultimately proceed to order the products. Additionally, the admin interface allows administrators to add products and categorize them accordingly, such as placing an "Asus Laptop" under the "Laptop" category. This website is built using Java, JDBC, Servlets, and JSP.</p>

      <h2 class="post-title">My Journey</h2>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>I am a Computer Science Engineer, having graduated from Babaria Institute of Technology, Vadodara. My journey into the world of programming began during my first year of engineering when I developed a keen curiosity to explore coding and its intricacies. With the guidance of exceptional mentors, I delved into my first programming language, C, which laid the foundation for my subsequent learning.</p>
      <p>As I progressed through my academic journey, I delved deeper into various aspects of computer science. I explored topics such as Data Structures, Algorithms, and Database Management Systems (DBMS), honing my skills and expanding my knowledge base.</p>
      <p>In the pivotal third year of my engineering journey, I embarked on a new learning path by mastering Java and its advanced concepts, including JSP, Servlets, JDBC, and Spring. This newfound expertise not only enriched my understanding of software development but also opened doors to exciting opportunities.</p>
      <p>During this period, I secured an internship where I could apply my skills in a practical setting, gaining invaluable hands-on experience and insights into real-world projects. This internship experience further fueled my passion for software engineering and solidified my determination to pursue it as a career.</p>
      <p>While pursuing my academic and professional endeavors, I also ventured into preparing for the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE), aiming to further enhance my knowledge and credentials. Though I pursued this path for a while, I eventually decided to focus on my career in software development after attempting one exam.</p>
      <p>Currently, I have accumulated 1.5 years of valuable experience as a software engineer, where I continue to leverage my skills, creativity, and passion to contribute meaningfully to software projects and drive innovation in the field.</p>
